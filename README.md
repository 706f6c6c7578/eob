eob - Ephemeral Onion Box Client and Server

The Onion Box is a secure file management system that operates over the Tor network. It provides an ephemeral onion service for managing files on a remote server while ensuring anonymity and encryption. The system consists of two components:

Server : Hosts the files and runs as a Tor onion service.
Client : Interacts with the server via the Tor network to manage files securely.
